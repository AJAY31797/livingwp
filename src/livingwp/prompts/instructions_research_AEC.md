Collect and synthesize the latest information on AI adoption in a specific industry within New Zealand, producing a detailed and well-organized report that serves as a "Living Whitepaper." This report should include recent news, research, and case studies, offering a high-level snapshot of the current state of AI. 

# Gather Information

- Search and collect the latest news articles, research papers, academic research papers from New Zealand Universities (University of Auckland, University of Canterbury, Auckland University of Technology, Massey University), and case studies related to AI adoption in the specified industry within New Zealand.
- Focus on reputable sources for accurate and relevant information.
- For academic research papers from New Zealand Universities, search on Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar database, and use the papers in which authors are from a New Zealand University. 
- For research capabilities, search university websites.
- The scope should include AI adoption and applications in Architectural and Structural Design, Construction, Supply chain, Prefabricated/Offsite manufacturing, Operation and maintenance, Safety and risk management, Infrastructure and smart cities, Sustainability and lifecycle management, Architecture Engineering and Construction Education, AI Education in AEC industry. Anything not related to AI should not be included.
- Only include information where the source explicitly uses terms such as “AI,” “artificial intelligence,” “machine learning,” “deep learning,” “computer vision,” "reinforcement learning,""computer vision," “predictive analytics,” “natural language processing,” “LLM,” “model training,” “data-driven prediction,” or similar. If AI is not explicitly stated, exclude the source.

# Content Organization

- Create clear headings and subheadings to structure the report, ensuring it's easy to navigate.
- Use bullet points for concise information and summaries.
- Highlight key findings and insights in each section.

# Analysis and Synthesis

- Analyze the collected information to identify patterns, trends, and important developments within the industry.
- Provide a synthesis of findings to offer a comprehensive view of AI adoption and its impacts.

# Steps

1. **Research Collection**: Gather recent information on AI adoption from reputable sources.
2. **Information Sorting**: Categorize the information into sections such as News, Research Papers, Case Studies, Trends, and Conclusions.
3. **Content Development**: Write the report using clear headings and subheadings. Summarize findings in a digestible format.
4. **Conclusion Synthesis**: Conclude with an overall assessment of AI adoption in the industry.
5. **Publication Preparation**: Prepare the report for automatic publication, ensuring it meets format requirements.

# Output Format

- Use headings and subheadings for clarity.

# Notes

- Ensure all sources are credible and up-to-date.
- Aim for an informative yet concise report suitable for industry professionals seeking quick insights.
- Consider the audience: mainly stakeholders within the New Zealand industry looking for strategic insights.
- If a previous report is provided, use this as a baseline and update it with the latest findings.
- When referencing files provide citation text using a source URL in the document, or the source, title, author and date of a paper or article. Do not include direct file:// links.
- Use Markdown to format the report.
- Do not include follow-up questions or suggestions for the user in the response.
