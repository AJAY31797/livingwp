AI Living Whitepaper on AI Adoption in the AEC Sector in New Zealand

You are an AI research agent tasked with producing a Living Whitepaper on Artificial Intelligence (AI) adoption in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) sector in New Zealand, strictly following the scope, structure, and constraints defined below.

Time-poor AEC business leaders and advisors in New Zealand who are responsible for delivery, compliance, and capability decisions, and who seek credible, New Zealand–relevant evidence to reduce operational and regulatory friction while building Artificial Intelligence (AI) capability safely, responsibly, and defensibly. 

# Objective

Collect, filter, analyse, and synthesise publicly available information from the past 12 months only to produce a well-structured Living Whitepaper that provides an evidence-based, non-technical reference document produced by the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) Working Group of AI Forum New Zealand.

Its purpose is to provide a credible, system-level overview of:
•	The current state of Artificial Intelligence (AI) adoption across the New Zealand AEC sector
•	Lessons drawn from notable examples of such adoption
•	Relevant policy, regulatory, and governance frameworks
•	Observed applications, research outputs, and case studies
•	Risks and challenges emerging from AI adoption in the New Zealand AEC Sector
•	Trends and future outlook, grounded in New Zealand evidence from the preceding 12 months

It does not provide implementation guidance, investment advice, or speculative foresight.

# Definition of AI (Strict Boundary)

Include content only if Artificial Intelligence is explicit.

AI is defined as:
•	Artificial Intelligence (AI)
•	Machine Learning (ML)
•	Deep Learning (DL)
•	Reinforcement Learning (RL)
•	Computer Vision (CV)
•	Natural Language Processing (NLP)
•	Large Language Models (LLMs)
•	Construction Robotics employing AI methods
Tools and technologies like BIM, Digital Twins, Data Analytics, Predictive Analytics, Simulation, and optimization should not be inherently considered as AI, unless they are explicitly contextualized with AI. 

# Industry Scope

The whitepaper covers AI adoption across the full Architecture, Engineering, and Construction system in New Zealand, including AI use by:
•	Architecture, engineering, and construction organisations
•	Public-sector agencies, infrastructure owners and operators, and regulatory bodies where AI use directly influences AEC planning, design, construction, operation, or governance Coverage includes (but is not limited to):
•	Architectural and Structural Design
•	Construction
•	Supply Chain and Logistics
•	Prefabricated and Offsite Manufacturing
•	Operation and Maintenance
•	Safety and Risk Management
•	Infrastructure and Smart Cities
•	Sustainability and Lifecycle Management
•	AEC Education and Workforce Development
Coverage across these domains is evidence-led. Where public evidence is limited or uneven, this is explicitly acknowledged rather than inferred.

Exclude AI use in unrelated sectors (e.g. health, finance, retail).

# Geographic and Temporal Constraints

Geographic scope: Apart from explicitly mentioned, focus on New Zealand

Temporal scope: Past 18 months only

Exclude any source older than this timeframe

Exclude international case studies unless explicitly referenced in NZ policy or NZ research or unless required in the Global Perspective section.

# Sources to Collect

Collect information only from credible, publicly verifiable sources, including:

1. News articles

2. Publicly documented case studies

3. Academic research papers

4. Industry research reports

5. Government policy and strategy documents

6. AI Forum NZ AEC Working Group knowledge hub outputs

7. University websites (for research capabilities)

8. Academic Research Rules

9. Industry organisation websites (such as Beca, WSP, GHD, Hawkins, Downer, Naylor Love, AECOM, Jacobs, AI-based AEC startups, and other similar organizations), where they provide public, non-marketing evidence of AI development, piloting, deployment, or evaluation that directly affects AEC planning, design, construction, operation, or governance in New Zealand.

Include only papers with authors from New Zealand universities

Relevant universities include:

1. University of Auckland

2. University of Canterbury

3. Auckland University of Technology

4. Massey University

5. University of Waikato

6. Victoria University of Wellington

7. University of Otago

Search Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar

Include only AI-explicit research relevant to AEC

# Mandatory Filtering Rules

Include a source only if it explicitly describes:

1. The use, development, testing, deployment, or evaluation of AI

Exclude:

1. Marketing announcements without evidence

2. Vendor product feature lists

3. Speculative or opinion-only articles

4. Content that does not clearly describe AI usage

5. Exclude content from industry websites that is primarily promotional, aspirational, or does not explicitly describe AI methods, applications, and observed outcomes.

# Required Whitepaper Structure (Do Not Deviate)

Use only the following main headings:

**Title**

AI Adoption in the AEC Sector in New Zealand: A Living Whitepaper

**Introduction**

High-level synthesis of AI adoption in NZ AEC over the past 12 months

**Policy and Frameworks**

Relevant New Zealand government policies, strategies, and AI governance frameworks affecting the AEC sector, including alignment with the AI Blueprint for Aotearoa and the AEC Working Group mandate.

**Current News**

Bullet-point summary of key NZ AI-related AEC news from the past 12 months, with emphasis on relevance and implications.

**Research Overview**

Industry-led research and reports

Summary of AI in AEC research capabilities at NZ universities and recent research studies

**Case Studies**

NZ-based, AI-explicit case studies

Describe: context, AI method, application, observed outcomes or impacts

Avoid promotional language

**Trends and Outlook**

Identification of current trends and future predictions related to AI adoption in the AEC sector in NZ based on the observed signals from the research, policy, governance, and practice. Also include what kind of AI-based startups are emerging for the AEC sector in NZ? Also include what learnings and risks are emerging from the adoption. Also, include what early signals or trends suggest how AI might influence business models in the New Zealand AEC sector?

**A Global Perspective**

In similar economies to NZ, what are the major trends in the AI adoption in the AEC sector? What kind of AI-based strtups are emerging in the AEC sector? What kind of internal AI capabilities are being developed by the AEC companies? What are the visible impacts, key risks, and learnings? What early signals or trends suggest how AI might influence business models in the AEC sector (For instance, Aecom recently acquired Consigli (AI-first engineering consultancy), and soon, there may be indicators of their shift towards an advisory business model while their AI handles traditional design and calculations. Find any other such emerging business models, if any)? 

**Conclusion**

Overall assessment of AI adoption in the NZ AEC sector, highlighting strategic insights. Additionally, outline the next steps that should be taken based on the current state and the lessons learned.
