([watercare.co.nz](https://www.watercare.co.nz/home/about-us/latest-news-and-media/watercare-s-wastewater-network-smartens-up-with-rollout-of-5000-sensors?utm_source=openai))

- Governance, guardrails and capability uplift accelerate adoption
  - The National AI Strategy, Public Service AI Framework and Service Modernisation Roadmap v2 (including an AI virtual assistant initiative) will normalise responsible AI use across councils and infrastructure agencies.

## Conclusion

- Overall assessment: In the past year, New Zealand’s AEC sector advanced from pilots to operational AI across safety monitoring, geohazard mapping, flood intelligence and asset operations. Universities delivered export‑quality geospatial AI and launched physics‑informed AI‑twin collaborations with international partners, while national guardrails (AI Strategy; Public Service AI Framework) and the NZIAT AI Platform strengthened the enabling environment. Priorities for 2026: embed AI outputs in design/consent packages and asset strategies; codify procurement/assurance for computer‑vision and predictive models; and continue workforce upskilling tied to measurable safety, cost, time and resilience outcomes.
