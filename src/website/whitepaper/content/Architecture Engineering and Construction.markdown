# AI in Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) in Aotearoa New Zealand: A Living Whitepaper

- Updated: 18 November 2025

## Introduction

- Snapshot (Nov 2024–Nov 2025): New Zealand’s AEC system is operationalising AI across consenting/inspections, transport ticketing, hazard transparency, infrastructure data foundations, safety analytics, and offsite manufacturing—under clearer national guardrails (AI Strategy; Public Service AI Framework) and new building‑system levers (inspection service levels; overseas product recognition). A rebound in September 2025 dwelling consents (3,747; +27% y/y; seasonally adjusted +7.2% m/m) points to renewed pipeline pressure and the need for AI‑assisted pre‑checks and evidence workflows. ([mbie.govt.nz](https://www.mbie.govt.nz/about/news/artificial-intelligence-strategy-and-business-guidance-now-available?utm_source=openai))

## Policy and Frameworks

- National AI Strategy (8 Jul 2025): NZ’s first AI Strategy sets direction aligned to OECD principles and publishes business guidance to “invest with confidence.” ([mbie.govt.nz](https://www.mbie.govt.nz/about/news/artificial-intelligence-strategy-and-business-guidance-now-available?utm_source=openai))  
- Public Service AI Framework (29 Jan 2025): System‑level principles and pillars for safe, human‑centric AI across agencies; AI Expert Advisory Panel appointed (30 Jun 2025). ([digital.govt.nz](https://www.digital.govt.nz/standards-and-guidance/technology-and-architecture/artificial-intelligence/public-service-artificial-intelligence-framework?trk=public_post_comment-text&utm_source=openai))  
- Responsible GenAI guidance (updated 3 Feb 2025): Practical governance, transparency, security, procurement and skills expectations for public sector use—relevant to AEC procurements. ([digital.govt.nz](https://www.digital.govt.nz/standards-and-guidance/technology-and-architecture/artificial-intelligence/responsible-ai-guidance-for-the-public-service-genai?utm_source=openai))  
- Service Modernisation Roadmap v2 (10 Nov 2025): All‑of‑Government roadmap accelerates service transformation (including AI) across frontline regulatory/infrastructure agencies. ([digital.govt.nz](https://www.digital.govt.nz/news/service-modernisation-roadmap-v2-is-live-2?utm_source=openai))  
- Building inspection timeframes (in force 22 Aug 2025): BCAs must complete ≥80% of inspections within three working days; MBIE monitoring performance. ([mbie.govt.nz](https://www.mbie.govt.nz/about/news/building-inspection-timeframes-now-in-effect?utm_source=openai))  
- Remote inspections policy track (1 Aug 2025): Submissions show broad support for increasing remote inspections; options include requiring BCA capability and creating offences to deter deception. ([mbie.govt.nz](https://www.mbie.govt.nz/building-and-energy/building/building-and-construction-consultations/summary-of-submissions-improving-efficiency-in-the-inspection-process?utm_source=openai))  
- Overseas products recognition (from 1 Oct 2025): 92,000+ WaterMark‑certified plumbing products recognised and must be accepted by BCAs when notice conditions are met; endorsed standards also recognised. Phase‑2 recognitions open for feedback (due 28 Nov 2025). ([mbie.govt.nz](https://www.mbie.govt.nz/about/news/new-pathways-for-overseas-building-products-implemented?utm_source=openai))  
- National Infrastructure Plan (draft, 25 Jun 2025): 30‑year plan aims to make investment more consistent and “build common ground”; signals higher relative spend on hospitals and electricity, moderated land-transport growth. Final due end‑2025. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/new-zealand-draft-infrastructure-plan-outlines-need-more-hospitals-electricity-2025-06-25/?utm_source=openai))

## Trends and Predictions

- AI‑assisted consenting and inspections will scale  
  - Expect broader deployment of AI for pre‑submission completeness checks, evidence extraction and assistive RFI drafting in council portals; remote/virtual inspections to expand given service‑level requirements and MBIE’s policy signals. ([mbie.govt.nz](https://www.mbie.govt.nz/about/news/building-inspection-timeframes-now-in-effect?utm_source=openai))

- Safety analytics and active machine control  
  - Computer‑vision safety analytics and machine “digital shields” likely to extend across rail, TTM and constrained urban sites as regulator‑endorsed methods to cut near‑misses/downtime. ([nzta.govt.nz](https://www.nzta.govt.nz/projects/te-ara-tupua/te-ara-tupua-lead-construction-sector-with-digital-shields-innovation/?utm_source=openai))

- Model‑centric delivery with connected clouds  
  - Forma–ACC connections and GIS links point to cloud‑linked, AI‑assisted, model‑centric delivery becoming default; expect deeper interoperability and AI‑readiness of design data across lifecycle. ([blogs.autodesk.com](https://blogs.autodesk.com/forma/2025/06/03/autodesk-forma-connects-to-autodesk-construction-cloud/?utm_source=openai))

- Infrastructure data foundations mature  
  - AMDS Network Model and Motu Move datasets set the stage for predictive maintenance, smarter network planning and demand‑responsive urban development. ([nzta.govt.nz](https://www.nzta.govt.nz/roads-and-rail/asset-management-data-standard/amds-network-model?utm_source=openai))

- Supply chain and product evidence streamline  
  - Overseas product recognitions and endorsed standards reduce evidence friction for plumbing and potentially other systems; further recognitions pending. ([mbie.govt.nz](https://www.mbie.govt.nz/about/news/new-pathways-for-overseas-building-products-implemented?utm_source=openai))

- Capability building and research transfer  
  - NZIAT’s multi‑year AI platform, university initiatives (ABI physics‑informed AI; UC AI flood‑forecasting; Waikato’s industrial twins) and sector bodies (ITSNZ, OffsiteNZ) are accelerating construction informatics, safety analytics, geospatial workflows and offsite adoption. ([mbie.govt.nz](https://www.mbie.govt.nz/about/news/new-zealand-institute-for-advanced-technology-launches-major-ai-investment?utm_source=openai))

## Conclusion

- Overall assessment: In the past year, Aotearoa’s AEC ecosystem has moved decisively from pilots to operation under clearer guardrails—AI strategy and public‑service guidance, enforced inspection service levels, overseas‑product acceptance, a maturing infrastructure plan, and stronger transport/infrastructure data foundations. Councils and firms are deploying AI in inspections, hazard transparency, smart mobility and site safety; universities and new investments strengthen the research‑to‑practice pipeline. Scaling impact now hinges on:  
  - interoperable data foundations and model‑centric workflows (AMDS, Motu Move, Forma/ACC),  
  - procurement that embeds AI governance and transparency,  
  - outcome measurement (time–cost–safety–carbon), and  
  - sustained workforce upskilling aligned to digital‑twin and AI competencies.  
  With these, AI can materially lift AEC productivity, resilience and sustainability in Aotearoa. ([digital.govt.nz](https://www.digital.govt.nz/standards-and-guidance/technology-and-architecture/artificial-intelligence/responsible-ai-guidance-for-the-public-service-genai?utm_source=openai))
