**Title**

AI Adoption in the AEC Sector in New Zealand: A Living Whitepaper

---

**Introduction**

- **Scope window (this update): 18 December 2024–18 December 2025.** Public evidence within this 12‑month window shows **measurable movement from pilots to early operational AI** in AEC-adjacent activity that directly shapes built-environment outcomes in New Zealand—especially **hazard intelligence (flood nowcasting; landslide susceptibility), local-government information access (LLM assistants), water network operations (AI anomaly detection), and worksite safety (computer vision/ML event detection)**. ([callaghaninnovation.govt.nz](https://www.callaghaninnovation.govt.nz/stories/ai-flood-forecasting-in-real-time/?utm_source=openai))
- **System-level pattern:** The most visible NZ deployments are **risk- and infrastructure-centric**, where:
  - data volumes exceed human analysis capacity (e.g., millions of road-segment features; dense sensor networks), and
  - decision timeliness is critical (flood response; overflow prevention; safety event detection). ([infocouncil.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz](https://infocouncil.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/Open/2024/12/20241205_TICCC_AGN_11416.htm?utm_source=openai))
- **Enabling environment:** 2025 saw strengthened **national policy guardrails** (AI Strategy; Public Service AI Framework; Responsible AI guidance) and **public funding signals** (NZIAT AI Research Platform shortlist) that are directly relevant to AEC governance, council operations, and infrastructure delivery. ([mbie.govt.nz](https://www.mbie.govt.nz/business-and-employment/economic-growth/digital-policy/new-zealands-ai-strategy-investing-with-confidence?utm_source=openai))
- **Evidence limitations:** Public reporting is strongest for **what was built/piloted and why**, but uneven for **quantitative performance metrics, false-positive/false-negative rates, and cost/benefit outcomes**, especially in customer-facing LLM assistants and safety pilots. ([ourauckland.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz](https://ourauckland.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/news/2025/02/auckland-council-ai-initiative-to-boost-customer-experience/?utm_source=openai))

**Trends and Outlook**

- **Hazard intelligence as an operational input to infrastructure planning and delivery**
  - Evidence indicates AI is increasingly used to create decision layers for **resilience planning** (e.g., landslide susceptibility GIS) and **rapid flood impact forecasting** (inundation nowcasting). ([infocouncil.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz](https://infocouncil.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/Open/2024/12/20241205_TICCC_AGN_11416.htm?utm_source=openai))
- **Scaling “sense-and-predict” operations in water utilities**
  - AI anomaly detection is emerging as a core pattern for shifting from reactive response to proactive intervention, enabled by large sensor deployments. ([watercare.co.nz](https://www.watercare.co.nz/home/about-us/latest-news-and-media/watercare-s-wastewater-network-smartens-up-with-rollout-of-5000-sensors?utm_source=openai))
- **Computer vision in site safety: practical pilots, limited published metrics**
  - Council-public documentation demonstrates feasible on-site event detection use (falls, intrusion, PPE, traffic speed). However, public evidence of precision/recall, false alarms, or quantified safety outcome changes remains limited. ([huttcity.govt.nz](https://www.huttcity.govt.nz/people-and-communities/news/2025/ai-driving-safety-changes-at-tupua-horo-nuku?utm_source=openai))
- **LLMs entering planning and customer interfaces—high potential, governance-heavy**
  - NZ public evidence shows movement into resident-facing information access and planning scholarship signals LLM applicability to text-heavy planning workflows (submissions, policy interpretation), with the main challenge being responsible deployment and trust. ([ourauckland.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz](https://ourauckland.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/news/2025/02/auckland-council-ai-initiative-to-boost-customer-experience/?utm_source=openai))
- **Governance and assurance are becoming first-order adoption conditions**
  - Public sector frameworks and GenAI guidance emphasise transparency, human oversight, risk management and alignment with OECD principles, reinforcing that “permission to scale” depends on defensibility and public trust. ([digital.govt.nz](https://www.digital.govt.nz/standards-and-guidance/technology-and-architecture/artificial-intelligence/public-service-artificial-intelligence-framework?trk=public_post_comment-text&utm_source=openai))
- **Startup signals in NZ AEC (evidence-limited in public sources)**
  - Within this window, the clearest NZ AEC-adjacent startup signal in publicly cited deployments is **RUSH Digital** providing ML/computer-vision capability for worksite safety analytics. Broader NZ “AEC AI startup” mapping is not consistently evidenced in public, non-promotional sources within the defined window. ([huttcity.govt.nz](https://www.huttcity.govt.nz/people-and-communities/news/2025/ai-driving-safety-changes-at-tupua-horo-nuku?utm_source=openai))
- **Early signals of business-model change in NZ AEC (evidence-limited)**
  - In NZ public evidence within this window, AI is most clearly positioned as **augmenting operational decision-making** in councils/utilities rather than replacing core design service business models. Evidence of widespread shifts to AI-first delivery pricing or advisory-heavy models in NZ AEC firms is limited in public sources for this period. ([digital.govt.nz](https://www.digital.govt.nz/dmsdocument/263~full-results-2025-cross-agency-survey-for-artificial-intelligence-ai-use-cases/html?utm_source=openai))
- **Recurrent risks and challenges (observed across NZ evidence)**
  - **Data quality/coverage** (hazard models and DEMs; sensor placement and reliability). ([mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/17/21/3591?utm_source=openai))  
  - **Privacy and surveillance concerns** (computer vision on worksites; council-facing assistants). ([huttcity.govt.nz](https://www.huttcity.govt.nz/people-and-communities/news/2025/ai-driving-safety-changes-at-tupua-horo-nuku?utm_source=openai))  
  - **Capability constraints** (skills, organisational readiness), consistent with government survey findings about adoption barriers and controls maturity. ([digital.govt.nz](https://www.digital.govt.nz/dmsdocument/263~full-results-2025-cross-agency-survey-for-artificial-intelligence-ai-use-cases/html?utm_source=openai))  
  - **Transparency and validation gaps** (limited publication of performance metrics and assurance practices for some deployments). ([digital.govt.nz](https://www.digital.govt.nz/standards-and-guidance/technology-and-architecture/artificial-intelligence/responsible-ai-guidance-for-the-public-service-genai/overview?utm_source=openai))

**A Global Perspective**

- **Large engineering firms positioning proprietary AI as operating leverage**
  - AECOM publicly attributes increased operating leverage opportunity to proprietary **“AECOM AI”** and growth in higher-margin **Advisory**, and notes multi-year investment in AI capabilities (including specialised staff) as part of scaling delivery differently. ([businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251118350382/en/AECOM-announces-increased-financial-targets-built-on-further-extending-its-competitive-advantage-and-accelerating-operating-leverage?utm_source=openai))
- **Agentic/automation-first tools entering early-stage engineering and BIM workflows**
  - Consigli reports commercial agreements with major contractors/consultancies (e.g., Skanska agreement to employ its “Autonomous Engineer”; AECOM collaboration messaging), indicating global experimentation with LLMs and broader AI methods in early-stage technical system design and project risk analysis. ([consigli.ai](https://www.consigli.ai/articles/skanska-entering-deal-with-consigli?utm_source=openai))
- **Infrastructure sector surveys: growth intent with material risk-control gaps**
  - Survey reporting highlighted by ASCE (Dec 8, 2025) indicates widespread experimentation/adoption and expectations for higher penetration in design/engineering and construction, while also identifying risks tied to data sharing/IP, privacy, cybersecurity, and skills gaps—and noting many firms have limited project controls for AI risk in design/construction. ([asce.org](https://www.asce.org/publications-and-news/civil-engineering-source/article/2025/12/08/ai-use-in-infrastructure-set-to-soar-as-firms-weigh-risks-and-returns?utm_source=openai))
- **Municipal-scale computer vision for asset defects (peer-economy analogue)**
  - UK local authority examples describe AI/computer vision to detect potholes and other road defects via vehicle-mounted cameras, illustrating scaled public-asset inspection patterns analogous to transport asset contexts relevant to NZ agencies. ([theregister.com](https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/21/ai_pothole_patrol/?utm_source=openai))
- **Early signals of business-model change (global)**
  - Public disclosures suggest a shift toward **reusable proprietary AI assets** and **advisory expansion** as value-capture mechanisms (less linear coupling between revenue and variable delivery cost), alongside experimentation with AI-first workflow automation in early-stage design and analysis. ([businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251118350382/en/AECOM-announces-increased-financial-targets-built-on-further-extending-its-competitive-advantage-and-accelerating-operating-leverage?utm_source=openai))

**Conclusion**

- **Overall assessment (as at 18 December 2025).** Within the 18 December 2024–18 December 2025 evidence window, New Zealand’s AEC system shows **credible, AI-explicit adoption** concentrated in:
  - **hazard intelligence and resilience planning** (flood nowcasting; landslide susceptibility mapping), ([callaghaninnovation.govt.nz](https://www.callaghaninnovation.govt.nz/stories/ai-flood-forecasting-in-real-time/?utm_source=openai))  
  - **infrastructure operations** (AI anomaly detection in wastewater networks), ([watercare.co.nz](https://www.watercare.co.nz/home/about-us/latest-news-and-media/watercare-s-wastewater-network-smartens-up-with-rollout-of-5000-sensors?utm_source=openai))  
  - **worksite safety** (ML/computer vision event detection pilots), ([huttcity.govt.nz](https://www.huttcity.govt.nz/people-and-communities/news/2025/ai-driving-safety-changes-at-tupua-horo-nuku?utm_source=openai))  
  - and **council information access** (LLM-enabled assistants). ([ourauckland.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz](https://ourauckland.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/news/2025/02/auckland-council-ai-initiative-to-boost-customer-experience/?utm_source=openai))  
  This adoption is reinforced by **national policy frameworks** and visible **public investment signals** (NZIAT AI Research Platform). ([mbie.govt.nz](https://www.mbie.govt.nz/business-and-employment/economic-growth/digital-policy/new-zealands-ai-strategy-investing-with-confidence?utm_source=openai))
- **Strategic insights derived from evidence (non-prescriptive).**
  - AI adoption appears to progress fastest where **risk exposure is high** and **data volume/timeliness constraints** make traditional approaches insufficient (hazards, water networks, transport resilience). ([callaghaninnovation.govt.nz](https://www.callaghaninnovation.govt.nz/stories/ai-flood-forecasting-in-real-time/?utm_source=openai))  
  - **Public-service governance frameworks** are shaping what “defensible AI use” looks like in AEC-adjacent agencies, creating clearer expectations around transparency, oversight, and lifecycle risk management. ([digital.govt.nz](https://www.digital.govt.nz/standards-and-guidance/technology-and-architecture/artificial-intelligence/public-service-artificial-intelligence-framework?trk=public_post_comment-text&utm_source=openai))  
  - **Evidence gaps remain a constraint on sector-wide learning**, with limited public publication of outcome metrics and assurance results for several deployments—particularly for safety analytics and LLM-enabled customer/planning interfaces. ([huttcity.govt.nz](https://www.huttcity.govt.nz/people-and-communities/news/2025/ai-driving-safety-changes-at-tupua-horo-nuku?utm_source=openai))  
- **Next steps that should be taken (stated as system-level needs implied by current evidence, not implementation guidance).**
  - Improve the **consistency and transparency of public reporting** on AI deployments that affect built-environment outcomes (validation approach, limitations, and measured impacts).
