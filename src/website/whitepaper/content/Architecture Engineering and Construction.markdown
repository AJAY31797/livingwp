## Trends and Predictions

- Safety analytics will spread from pilots to portfolios
  - Expect wider deployment of computer‑vision risk detection across transport and civil worksites as local proofs (e.g., Lower Hutt) translate into procurement requirements. ([huttcity.govt.nz](https://www.huttcity.govt.nz/people-and-communities/news/2025/ai-driving-safety-changes-at-tupua-horo-nuku?utm_source=openai))

- Hazard intelligence becomes design input
  - Councils and consultants will embed AI‑enhanced elevation and nowcasting outputs into stormwater design, catchment planning and transport resilience programmes. ([mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/17/21/3591?utm_source=openai))

- Physics‑informed AI and digital twins enter delivery chains
  - NZ–US collaboration and university seminars point to AI‑coupled twins moving from research to industrial decarbonisation and, by extension, to building/infrastructure systems modelling and optimisation. ([auckland.ac.nz](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/2025/09/18/digital-twin-nz-us-collaboration-receives-catalyst-funding.html?utm_source=openai))

- Workforce and governance capacity uplift
  - National AI guardrails and investment (AI Strategy, Public Service AI Framework, NZIAT AI Platform) plus professional CPD around GenAI signal rapid capability building across public agencies and AEC firms. ([mbie.govt.nz](https://www.mbie.govt.nz/about/news/artificial-intelligence-strategy-and-business-guidance-now-available?utm_source=openai))

## Conclusion

- Overall assessment: Over the last 12 months, Aotearoa’s AEC sector has moved beyond experimentation to operational AI in safety monitoring, hazard mapping and flood intelligence, while universities have delivered export‑quality geospatial AI and launched physics‑informed AI twin programmes with international partners. With national guardrails (AI Strategy; Public Service AI Framework) and a new NZIAT AI Platform, the enabling environment now favours responsible scaling. Priorities for 2026: embed AI outputs directly into design/consent packages and asset strategies; codify procurement and assurance for computer‑vision and predictive models; and continue workforce upskilling tied to measurable safety, cost, time and resilience outcomes.
