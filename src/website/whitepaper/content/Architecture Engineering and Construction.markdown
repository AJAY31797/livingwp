# AI Adoption in the AEC Sector in New Zealand: A Living Whitepaper

## Introduction
- Scope window: 18 December 2024–18 December 2025. Evidence over the past year shows movement from pilots to early operational use of AI in hazard intelligence (flood nowcasting, landslide susceptibility), municipal information access, water network operations, and site safety. Policy guardrails (New Zealand’s AI Strategy; Public Service AI Framework; Responsible AI guidance for the Public Service and for businesses) and new research funding (NZIAT AI Research Platform) underpin uptake across councils and infrastructure agencies. University research advanced deep-learning elevation models and ML‑supported post‑earthquake classification using NZ datasets; planning scholarship highlights LLM roles in council workflows. ([mbie.govt.nz](https://www.mbie.govt.nz/about/news/artificial-intelligence-strategy-and-business-guidance-now-available?utm_source=openai))

## Policy and Frameworks
- New Zealand’s AI Strategy — “Investing with confidence” (MBIE, published 8 July 2025). First national AI strategy; aligns with OECD AI Principles; emphasises adoption across the economy, including public services that influence AEC planning, consenting and infrastructure delivery. ([mbie.govt.nz](https://www.mbie.govt.nz/about/news/artificial-intelligence-strategy-and-business-guidance-now-available?utm_source=openai))
- Public Service AI Framework (DIA/GCDO, last updated 29 January 2025). Sets vision, principles and a six‑pillar work programme for lawful, safe, responsible AI across the Public Service; relevant to council and infrastructure workflows touching AEC. ([digital.govt.nz](https://www.digital.govt.nz/standards-and-guidance/technology-and-architecture/artificial-intelligence/public-service-artificial-intelligence-framework?trk=public_post_comment-text&utm_source=openai))

## Case Studies
1) Road network landslide susceptibility modelling (Auckland Transport, 2025)  
- Context: 2000+ slips in early‑2023 events prompted development of a predictive risk framework.  
- AI method and application: AI applied to geospatial factors to model susceptibility at 12.5 m segments across ~8,000 km; GIS layer to interrogate drivers (slope, drainage, geology) and prioritise works.  
- Observed outcomes: Supports proactive remediation and forward‑works programming; informs resilience and community engagement. ([insite.ipwea.org](https://insite.ipwea.org/auckland-transport-harnesses-ai-to-build-resilience/?utm_source=openai))

2) Elevation super‑resolution for flood and infrastructure planning (University of Canterbury, 2025)  
- Context: Many districts lack affordable LiDAR for detailed terrain modelling.  
- AI method and application: Deep‑learning (JSPSR) enhances global DEMs toward near‑LiDAR‑like bare‑earth accuracy using open satellite data.  
- Observed outcomes: Provides more accurate, lower‑cost elevation inputs for flood‑risk and infrastructure planning where LiDAR is unavailable. ([mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/17/21/3591?utm_source=openai))

3) ML flood‑inundation nowcasting (NIWA/ESNZ, 2025)  
- Context: Physical models are often too slow for rapidly evolving flood response.  
- AI method and application: Pre‑trained convolutional neural network generates hourly inundation maps in 1–2 minutes from sea‑level and river‑flow forecasts.  
- Observed outcomes: Reported high agreement with physical model outputs in a Westport case study and a pathway to operationalisation at high‑risk locations. ([callaghaninnovation.govt.nz](https://www.callaghaninnovation.govt.nz/stories/ai-flood-forecasting-in-real-time/?utm_source=openai))

4) Computer‑vision safety on civil works (Hutt City Council, Downer, RUSH; May 2025)  
- Context: Improving safety on a live coastal pathway/seawall project.  
- AI method and application: ML/computer‑vision cameras detect falls, no‑go intrusions, PPE use, and traffic speed in temporary traffic management.  
- Observed outcomes: Near‑real‑time alerts to augment supervision; privacy controls aligned to NZ guidance. ([huttcity.govt.nz](https://www.huttcity.govt.nz/people-and-communities/news/2025/ai-driving-safety-changes-at-tupua-horo-nuku?utm_source=openai))

5) Predictive network operations for wastewater (Watercare, Aug–Sep 2025)  
- Context: Reducing overflows and enabling condition‑based maintenance across the network.  
- AI method and application: Sensors with AI analytics learn normal behaviour; fusing sensor, weather, tide and groundwater data to flag anomalies.  
- Observed outcomes: Early prevention of an Ōtara overflow; shift from reactive to proactive maintenance underway. ([watercare.co.nz](https://www.watercare.co.nz/home/about-us/latest-news-and-media/watercare-s-wastewater-network-smartens-up-with-rollout-of-5000-sensors?utm_source=openai))

6) LLM assistant for council service navigation (Auckland Council, Feb 2025)  
- Context: ~1.5 million annual calls; information fragmented across group sites.  
- AI method and application: Cloud LLM‑enabled assistant to retrieve and summarise information across council platforms.  
- Observed outcomes: Anticipated lower effort for residents; reusable pattern for other councils; pilot progressing to testing. ([ourauckland.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz](https://ourauckland.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/news/2025/02/auckland-council-ai-initiative-to-boost-customer-experience/?utm_source=openai))

## Trends and Outlook
- Hazard intelligence embedded into planning inputs. Deep‑learning elevation and ML hazard products (flood, landslide) are moving from trials to operational layers used in resilience planning and forward works. ([mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/17/21/3591?utm_source=openai))
- Scaling of computer‑vision safety analytics on worksites. Live piloting on traffic‑managed civil projects shows practical event detection and alerting; councils are publishing governance/transparency patterns. Evidence of outcome metrics remains limited. ([huttcity.govt.nz](https://www.huttcity.govt.nz/people-and-communities/news/2025/ai-driving-safety-changes-at-tupua-horo-nuku?utm_source=openai))
- Predictive O&M in water utilities. AI‑enabled anomaly detection is informing proactive maintenance and overflow prevention as sensor coverage grows. ([watercare.co.nz](https://www.watercare.co.nz/home/about-us/latest-news-and-media/watercare-s-wastewater-network-smartens-up-with-rollout-of-5000-sensors?utm_source=openai))
- LLMs augment planning and customer interfaces. Councils piloting AI assistants, and NZ scholarship highlights LLM support for text‑heavy planning workflows (policy interpretation, submissions analysis). ([ourauckland.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz](https://ourauckland.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/news/2025/02/auckland-council-ai-initiative-to-boost-customer-experience/?utm_source=openai))
- Policy guardrails and investment signals. National AI Strategy, Public Service AI Framework, cross‑agency AI survey and NZIAT investments indicate growing operational confidence and capability building. ([mbie.govt.nz](https://www.mbie.govt.nz/business-and-employment/economic-growth/digital-policy/new-zealands-ai-strategy-investing-with-confidence?utm_source=openai))
- Workforce and research pipelines. New AI degree pathways and international collaborations (physics‑informed AI digital twins) strengthen local capability relevant to built‑environment modelling and operations. ([massey.ac.nz](https://www.massey.ac.nz/about/news/new-artificial-intelligence-major-set-to-launch-in-2026/?utm_source=openai))
- Risks and governance themes observed. Recurrent issues include transparency, human oversight, data quality, privacy/security, skills gaps, and uneven documentation of benefits. NZ public‑sector guidance stresses transparency, accountability and “human‑in‑the‑loop” controls; survey data cites capability and security as barriers. ([digital.govt.nz](https://www.digital.govt.nz/standards-and-guidance/technology-and-architecture/artificial-intelligence/responsible-ai-guidance-for-the-public-service-genai/overview?utm_source=openai))
- Evidence gaps. Quantitative impact reporting (accuracy, false‑positive/negative rates, safety outcomes, ROI) for several AEC deployments remains sparse in public sources; further publication would improve defensibility and scaling.

## A Global Perspective
- Market shift toward AI‑enabled advisory and new operating models. AECOM’s 2025 Investor Day emphasised proprietary “AECOM AI” and expanding Advisory revenues; the firm is reviewing strategic alternatives for its Construction Management business, signalling a pivot to higher‑margin AI‑enabled services. ([markets.financialcontent.com](https://markets.financialcontent.com/stocks/article/bizwire-2025-11-18-aecom-announces-increased-financial-targets-built-on-further-extending-its-competitive-advantage-and-accelerating-operating-leverage?utm_source=openai))
- Partnerships with “AI‑first” engineering tools. AECOM publicly highlighted collaboration with Consigli’s “Autonomous Engineer” to accelerate early‑stage engineering; Skanska also announced a commercial agreement with Consigli — indicating interest in agentic AI for design and risk analysis. (Note: collaboration, not acquisition.) ([consigli.ai](https://www.consigli.ai/articles/aecom-first-in-the-industry-to-fully-embrace-ai-for-engineering-in-project-delivery?utm_source=openai))
- Adoption outlook and barriers in infrastructure. International surveys (professional bodies) report growing intention to use AI for design, estimation, scheduling and construction productivity, with risks concentrated around data sharing/IP, privacy, cybersecurity and skills gaps. ([asce.org](https://www.asce.org/publications-and-news/civil-engineering-source/article/2025/12/08/ai-use-in-infrastructure-set-to-soar-as-firms-weigh-risks-and-returns?utm_source=openai))
- Public‑sector use cases in peer economies. UK local authorities reported AI‑assisted road‑defect detection via computer vision, indicating scaled municipal applications that are analogous to NZ transport asset contexts. ([theregister.com](https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/21/ai_pothole_patrol/?utm_source=openai))
- Early signals on business‑model change. Global engineering firms are signalling margin expansion through proprietary AI, reuse of knowledge assets, and advisory growth; alliances with AI tool vendors and potential divestment of lower‑margin activities suggest a rebalancing of value capture from traditional hours‑based delivery toward AI‑enabled, outcome‑based services. (Synthesis from AECOM Investor Day disclosures and industry analyses.)

## Conclusion
- Overall assessment (as at 18 December 2025). NZ’s AEC sector shows tangible, AI‑explicit adoption in geospatial hazard intelligence, flood nowcasting, utility operations, municipal service access, and site safety — supported by national policy frameworks and new research funding. University‑industry links are driving applied research aligned to NZ risk contexts (flood, landslide, earthquakes). Momentum is clear, though public evidence of measurable outcomes remains uneven across use cases. ([mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/17/21/3591?utm_source=openai))
- Strategic insights derived from evidence (non‑prescriptive).
  - Operational AI advances fastest where high‑value data and critical risk contexts intersect (hazards, water networks, transport resilience). ([callaghaninnovation.govt.nz](https://www.callaghaninnovation.govt.nz/stories/ai-flood-forecasting-in-real-time/?utm_source=openai))
  - Clear guardrails plus capability investment correlate with adoption in AEC‑adjacent public services (councils, utilities). ([digital.govt.nz](https://www.digital.govt.nz/standards-and-guidance/technology-and-architecture/artificial-intelligence/public-service-artificial-intelligence-framework?trk=public_post_comment-text&utm_source=openai))
  - Documented validation, transparent metrics, privacy‑by‑design and human oversight are recurring enablers for defensible scale.
