## Introduction  

- Over the past 12 months, AI in New Zealand’s AEC ecosystem has shifted from exploratory pilots to early operational deployment in:
  - **Computer‑vision safety analytics** on active worksites.
  - **Geospatial and flood‑risk intelligence** via deep learning and machine learning.
  - **Predictive asset management** for linear infrastructure and utilities.
  - **Smart‑city service layers** using AI assistants.  
- This acceleration is underpinned by:
  - A new **National Artificial Intelligence Strategy** (July 2025) and public‑sector AI frameworks.
  - The launch of a **national AI research platform** for applied, industry‑linked AI.
  - Expanded **AI‑focused education and research programmes** in civil, construction and geospatial domains at NZ universities. ([mbie.govt.nz](https://www.mbie.govt.nz/about/news/artificial-intelligence-strategy-and-business-guidance-now-available?utm_source=openai))

## Policy and Frameworks  

- **National AI Strategy (8 July 2025 – MBIE)**
  - First whole‑of‑NZ strategy for **Artificial Intelligence**, aligning with **OECD AI Principles** and aiming to give businesses confidence to “safely use, develop and innovate with this transformative tech.” ([mbie.govt.nz](https://www.mbie.govt.nz/about/news/artificial-intelligence-strategy-and-business-guidance-now-available?utm_source=openai))  
  - Highlights AI as a lever to grow productivity and resilience across infrastructure and construction‑adjacent sectors.

- **Public‑sector AI landscape – GCDO cross‑agency survey (2025)**  
  - The **2025 cross‑agency survey of AI use cases** reports **272 AI use cases** across 70 agencies, with **55 deployed/operational** AI systems versus 15 in 2024 — a near‑fourfold increase in operational AI. ([digital.govt.nz](https://www.digital.govt.nz/dmsdocument/263~full-results-2025-cross-agency-survey-for-artificial-intelligence-ai-use-cases/html?utm_source=openai))  
  - While sector‑agnostic, many use cases relate to:
    - Geospatial analysis, prediction and planning.
    - Customer‑facing virtual assistants for local and central government services, relevant to planning and infrastructure consents.

- **NZIAT – Artificial Intelligence Research Platform (Call opened 23 October 2025)**  
  - MBIE’s **New Zealand Institute for Advanced Technology (NZIAT)** launched a **dedicated Artificial Intelligence Research Platform** funding call (Phase 1 applications opened 23 October 2025). ([mbie.govt.nz](https://www.mbie.govt.nz/science-and-technology/science-and-innovation/refocusing-the-science-innovation-and-technology-system/public-research-organisations/new-zealand-institute-for-advanced-technology/call-for-proposals-for-the-artificial-intelligence-research-platform?utm_source=openai))  
  - Up to **NZ$70m over seven years** (as announced in MBIE commentary) is intended to build a **nationally connected AI research capability**, explicitly targeting:
    - Industry‑aligned AI development.
    - Scaling applied AI projects that can include AEC use cases (e.g., predictive asset management, geospatial AI, digital twins).

- **Sector‑adjacent AI policy signals (2025)**
  - **Health Research Council “Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare” RFP (2025)** earmarks NZ$5m for AI research in health. While not built‑environment‑specific, it strengthens domestic expertise in **medical imaging, predictive analytics and AI assurance** — capabilities that are technically transferable to safety analytics, structural diagnostics and facilities management.

- **Implications for AEC**  
  - Councils and central agencies (e.g., Waka Kotahi, Kāinga Ora) are:
    - Building **assurance practices** (risk assessments, impact assessments, human‑in‑the‑loop controls) for AI systems that interact with the public.
    - Gradually normalising the use of **AI in planning, consenting and asset operations**, which reduces perceived risk for private AEC adopters.
  - In the medium term:
    - Expect **standard guidance** around documenting models, training data and validation processes for AI used in safety‑critical and regulatory contexts (e.g., structural assessments, safety analytics).
